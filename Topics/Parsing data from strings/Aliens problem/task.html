<div class="step-text">

<p>Imagine that you are an extraterrestrial contact specialist working at a Roswell base in 1947. But you can't make contact with aliens. And the problem is simple - their system of numbers is built from two values â€” the actual integer number itself and the second decimal number - its base. You need a program that will convert numbers from any available base to decimal.</p>
